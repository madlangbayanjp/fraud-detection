I optimized a machine learning project that I've found on youtube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Od5_z28iIE

In this project, he created a Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression with 96% accuracy **BUT** 2% precision
This means that it will be classified as a fraud even though it is not

What I did is that I optimized this fraud detection project. I experimented and used different algorithms to make the metrics as accurate as possible

Using different algorithms, I found out that the best one to use for this project is Random Forest since  it can handle **large** imbalances in data

## Features

- **Real-time Fraud Detection**: Predict fraudulent transactions instantly
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Easy-to-use Streamlit dashboard
- **Multiple Transaction Types**: Supports PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT, DEBIT, CASH_IN
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Uses engineered features for better accuracy

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** 
- **Streamlit** 
- **Pandas**
- **Joblib**

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is not included in this repository due to its large size. You can download the dataset from the following link:

- <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanalisiddiqui/fraud-detection-dataset?resource=download" target="_blank">Fraud Detection Dataset</a>

After downloading the dataset, place it in the project directory and update the file path in the code accordingly.

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run fraud_detection.py
```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`

3. Enter transaction details and click "Predict" to get fraud detection results

## Model Information

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Training Data**: Fraud Detection dataset with engineered features
- **Features Used**:
  - Transaction type, amount, account balances
  - Engineered ratios and flags
  - Transaction-specific amounts
